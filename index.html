  				<h2>Kari Cakes Photography</h2>
  				<p>
  					Hello there! My name is Kari and I currently live in Los Angeles, California. I take photos of all that captures my eye and I see the beauty in everything. Photography has always been a huge passion of mine and I plan to do what I love for the rest of my life. 
  				</p>
  				<p>
  					I do personal photo shoots, weddings, and events. As of now, photo shoots are $70 (one location, one outfit and editing included) Each additonal outfit is $10 and additional locations are $20. Weddings depend on the length and distance of the event. I also offer a wedding memory book for an additional charge.
  				</p> 
  				<p>
  					If you would like to have specific photos printed I can do that as well. Just let me know which photos and what size you would like. I believe in offering photos for a reasonable price because it is not about the money, but the joy in taking the photos. I love to learn new things about photography and simply can not get enough of it. If you have any further questions please feel free to contact me.
